Hexsweeper
==========

This is a very simple browser-based Minesweeper-like game, with hexagons instead of squares. It's still work in progress, a lot of fundamental features (counter, timer, setting grid sizes) are not yet implemented. But if you want, you can already play it at <https://cochrane.github.io/hexsweeper>.
